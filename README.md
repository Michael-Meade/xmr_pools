### Purpose
This tool purpose is to allow the user to search a buncn of different Monero mining pools for a certain address. The script will then add up Monero that was mined and display the results. When I dig into files that were dropped on my honey pot, I often run into malware that tries to mine Monero on my VPS. This script could be used to get a better idea on how much profit the malicious miner has mined using its victims machines.
